    "Tech-related jobs has been booming when technology went mainstream, especially data scientist role.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Glassdoor 2022, data scientist rank the top 3 best job in America for 7 years running. This ranking is based on the career opportunites rating, number of opening jobs, and the average salaries. The median base salary is $120,000. The job opening were also spiking up from 1,736 in 2016 to 10,071 in 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ecosystem does not depend on just data scientist alone, it involves upstream and downstream job roles - like product/project managers and software engineers. These jobs are equally important to ensure the democratization of technology to average users. Hence, many people flocked to tech industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the compensation structure vary from one company to another, and was not accessible equally to everyone. [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) was started to democratize the access of information to compensation structure across tech jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We want to expand this effort by creating an AI model (and subsequently a web app) that enable users to know the estimated annual compensation based on user inputs like year, company, level, title, location, years of experience, years at company and gender.*\n",
